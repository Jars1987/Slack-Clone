# Slack Chat Clone

Another clone inspired by Sonny Sangha.

In this Clone I learned how to work with react-firebase-hooks. This package of
hooks makes the code so much cleaner and so easy to use it is unbulievable the
power this can give to a Frontend Dev.

The other take out was my first experinced with styled components. Although I
did not used props with it I can still see how powerfull and handy this can be.

Keep coding, see you on the next build.
